=========================

This Shiny UI App takes input of a zoom level, then outputs the number of tiles and pixels required for such a map at that zoom level. It assumes 256 pixels per side (width/height) per tile.

Try adjusting the zoom level to learn about how many tiles and pixels are required for raster based slippy maps.
